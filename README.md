# On Lightning 

This is a collection of readings and resources on the past, present, and future of the Lightning Network
The topic is vast, but the idea here is to identify notable and useful books, articles,
and resources to make it easier to educate yourself.

Items are marked by medium: ðŸ“–books, ðŸ—£interviews, ðŸ“„articles, ðŸŽ¥videos, ðŸŽ§podcasts.
(All in English, for now.)

ðŸš§ This list is far from complete.
